Pitch Profile: 

Good pitch profile with no major changes needed at the moment. 

Strength Profile: 

Very evident deficiencies in concentric force, ranking on the lower end of the entire team with a 0.60 E:C Ratio. Upper body is lacking in ability to recruit force quickly and total peak force numbers as well. Low trunk rotation peak values as well. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Okay upper half with a lower half that holds him back with extremely low pelvis and trunk peak values that can be fixed through strengthening.
