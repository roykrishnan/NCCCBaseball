Pitch Profile: 

Two seam and four seam profile similarly in shape, meaning both are probably not needed. Slider and curveball group similarly as well signalling the need to just pick one. 

Strength Profile: 

Lean mass addition is necessary here more than anything else. Beyer is a really good athlete, displaces the body well, but his lack of mass is holding him back despite having really good acceleration deltas. Force = mass times acceleration, our major goal globally with him should be increasing mass while keeping acceleration the same (it can even go slightly lower). 


Biomechanics Profile: 

Arm's slightly late into ball release, and works pretty hard by itself due to lack of lean mass throughout the kinematic sequence supporting it. Low pelvis and torso peak values.
