Pitch Profile: 

Penner's fastball profiles in the dead zone, he does average 17 inches of horizontal break, but this ability is neutralized due to the fact he also averages 14.1 inches of vertical break. His two seam fastball has slightly less vertical break and further emphasis should be made on getting this number consistently to 13.0 and below. Currently there is not enough deviation between his four seam and two seam to justify throwing both. 

Strength Profile: 

Penner is deficient in the concentric phase, meaning he has to develop more explosive force both in the upper and lower body from depth (the 'push phase' in a squat/push up/bench press). Physical development in both the upper and lower body will also hopefully allow him to displace some nerve pain he's been experiencing and increase his fastball velocity. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Penner suffers from early trunk rotation in the extension phases moving down the mound. Holding torso counterrotation until his front foot has hit will allow him to potentially add some velocity. His ability to disassociate his pelvis from his torso in testing further ensures this as a problem. Furthermore, his throwing arm gets into max external rotation late as he breaks his hands from his glove and goes into internal rotation first, forcing him to be late into external rotation.
