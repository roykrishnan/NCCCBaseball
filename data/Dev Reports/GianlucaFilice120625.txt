Pitch Profile: 

Filice's pitch profile needs to be differentiated better. Better separation between his two seam fastball and four seam fastball is needed, as well as better separation between his curveball and his slider. Velocity increase should be an emphasis this offseason as well, as the fastball does have good shape, however with the past injury this should be done carefully. 

Strength Profile: 

Filice shows adequate strength ability, however, his big limiting factor is he weighed in at 153 lbs. Force is a proponent of mass times acceleration, and though he accelerates fine, more mass is required before he can project well on any scale. For comparison sake, the average weight for MLB pitchers is 210.66 lbs. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Arm speed is very low with Filice, but this makes sense given the injury history. A better lead leg block and pelvic rotation can help with better energy transfer to the upper half and potentially add a mile or two.
