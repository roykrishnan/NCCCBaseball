Pitch Profile: 

Both Matt Allen's fastballs (2 seam and 4 seam) seem to group together, with the two seamer having similar shape but significantly less velocity, leading to the worry that it could potentially speed up some bats. Good separation on fastball to breaking ball, will have to add velocity to be an effective contributor on this team. Could benefit from adding a cutter shape if velocity gain can't happen to create an even more diverse profile.  

Strength Profile: 
Slightly concentric force deficient profile. Good tissue reactivity in lower half and strong enough upper half. Torso strength is low, though Allen has the ability recruit muscle fiber quick, the peak values are quite low. A lack of strength in the shoulder during internal rotation was found, with this value being barely in a healthy range. Internal rotation in the left hip was flagged, most likely leading to less than optimal hip loading in the leg kick. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

An okay biomechanics profile where the major changes are going to come from alleviating the strength concerns.
