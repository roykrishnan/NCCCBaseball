Pitch Profile: 

McMurray looks to be the most complete player on this staff in terms of arsenal. Decent separation on his fastball and two seamer (could be slightly better), a changeup that profiles well off of it, and a slider (more of slurve) that is looks like is is reflected off of the y=x line. If the major limitation is strikes, every pen should be working on his command as if he can hone it in he has the strongest complete arsenal. 


Strength Profile: 

McMurray doesn't lack any strength in the lower half, however could improve reactivity of tissue (how quickly he can go from flexion to extension) with plyometric work (for example, hurdle hops into a box jump after squatting heavy). Trunk numbers look great, however, his arms external rotation put him in a range where if he's fatigued he should be susceptible to arm pain in the shoulder complex. Increasing this external rotation in a safe way (ex. eccentric cable rotations with an elevated front left knee) will help bulletproof his arm for what is most likely going to be a high workload season for him. 


Biomechanics Profile. 

Great biomechanics profile, nothing to change here. Knee flexion could be better, but this stems more from the strength profile breakdown (better reactivity of tissue through plyometrics will allow for better knee flexion).
