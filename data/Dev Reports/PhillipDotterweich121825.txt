Pitch Profile: 

Fastball and splitter behavior needs to stabilize to be able to get better expected outcomes. Curveball is a solid pitch on its own. 

Strength Profile: 

Good force plate assessment, no real glaring deficiencies in movement, lean mass addition needed globally. Single leg broad jump on the left side is low, this could contribute to a bad block. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Arm's slightly late into ball release, poor peak pelvis and torso values.
