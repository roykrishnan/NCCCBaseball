Pitch Profile: 

Four Seam Fastball and Two Seam Fastball profile very similarly, highlighting the need to only need to keep one of them, the uptick in RPM with the two seam highlights that is probably the pitch to keep. Changeup needs to be switched to the same grip as the two seam to allow for similar movement between the two, this will hopefully stabilize its behavior as well. Slider shape needs to worked on as a sweeper could play very well given his other pitches. 

Strength Profile: 

The lower body strength is present for Chubak but not the ability to displace it well, as he ranks dead last in the Horizontal Jumps Assessment across the board, a heavy plyometric focused program focusing on creating more of an athletic profile (eg. Triple Jumps), to focus on tissue reactivity and general springiness through the kinetic chain will benefit him immensely.  

Biomechanics Profile: 

Good upper hand mechanics, lower half struggles to get down the mound, this will be rectified by addressing the strength deficits outlined above.
