Pitch Profile: 

John Callahan's pitches don't show much natural deviation currently (other than his slider which shape wise is great, just needs to throw it harder). Changeup needs more horizontal break while killing vertical break (kick change grip might work here), while the two seam fastball and four seam fastball are too similar in shape to be regarded as different pitches. The splitter blends into the two seamer well, however, we want to see a slightly higher velocity difference as a camouflage pitch to ensure we don't speed up bats pull side. 

Strength Profile: 

Callahan sure really poor force ratios, registering far below the leaderboard in pushup ability and the counter movement jump, weight room maturity (not just moving heavy weight, but accelerating with weight quickly through an entire range of motion) will be the most important immediate value addition in his development.  

Biomechanics Profile: 

John shows an inability to disconnect his torso from his hips while working down the mound, showing adequate rotary ability, trunk stability, and no significant movement limitations, meaning he is functionally able to do this, however, does not have the awareness to do so on the mound, showing us the need for some mechanical re-patterning in order to fix this.
