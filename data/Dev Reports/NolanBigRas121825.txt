Pitch Profile: 

Good fastball and changeup shapes,  the gyro curveball he currently throws will benefit from more depth and increased velocity. Emphasis should be made on this to be able to create some sort of optimal breaking shape that he does not currently have. 


Strength Profile: 

Bigras has a strong enough lower half, the upper half could use slightly more development work but is on the edge of being strong enough. Very low peak values in torso rotation, this is where the majority of strength development should be focused on.


Biomechanics Profile: 

Low trunk rotation values most likely due to to poor rotational power found in strength testing.
