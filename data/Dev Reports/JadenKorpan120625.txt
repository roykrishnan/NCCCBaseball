Pitch Profile: 

Korpan has one of the better fastballs on the staff, and strong intent level behind them. The main focus in the next several weeks should be increasing the velocity on the 'curveball' and maintaining the same shape. Curveball profiles as a sweeper right now, not a problem at all, just something to note for coaches and catchers that the pitch is more horizontal than vertical. 

Strength Profile: 

Korpan needs to develop more explosive power and rate of force development in his every day lifting, this will help him increase his fastball and slider velocity. 


Biomechanics Profile: 

Korpan can use a little more hip hinge coming out of leg lift (in his back hip) as well as work with better internal rotation in the front arm, horizontaly working better with his front shoulder to create better trunk rotational velocity (which will hopefully translate to better mound velocity).
