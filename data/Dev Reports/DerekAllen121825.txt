Pitch Profile: 

Allen has a great arsenal that could be further amplified by creating a slider with more horizontal break (creating that Ottavino like profile). 

Strength Profile: 

High level physical projection left on the body, Allen is quite far from our lower body optimal scoring scale and can benefit with the addition of much more lean mass to aid in rate of force development in the lower and upper half. Moderate imbalances in rotational ability can be improved, along with peak values to get an even harder throwing prospect. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Weaker lower half values, and an inability to separate well from static testing manifest itself in the delivery. Alleviating strength concerns will easily rectify this.
