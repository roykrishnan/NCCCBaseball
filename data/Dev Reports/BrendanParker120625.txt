Pitch Profile: 

Parker has a good two seam fastball that will innately roll ground balls, his changeup parallels it closely adding deception well as a complementary pitch. The slider and curveball don't show enough movement separation currently to justify the added complexity of throwing them separately, though they show enough promise where if the slider can be raised more towards the zero line as a true sweeper or even a hybrid slider/cutter, the curveball will play even better due to its depth. Big focus should be on velocity addition to further amplify these shapes. 

Strength Profile: 

Parker shows concentric deficiencies in his Counter Movement Jump, signaling the need for strength programming that helps him increase explosive power and rate of force development. High level oh physical development is left on his body, with an emphasis on lean mass addition, explosive power and rate of force development needed for him to get to the next level. 


Biomechanics Profile: 

Parker heavily with a 'pushy arm action', not allowing himself to get into max external rotation well, or at the right times, and as a result putting himself at risky for shoulder and elbow injuries. A need for repatterining from the pelvis up is necessary, with Parker needing to hold counter rotation in the pelvis and torso longer, letting his throwing arm migrate into external rotation and being able to better leverage his frame. Below the pelvis, improvements should first be made in the weight room, to build a strong lower half and eliminate his concentric deficiencies before any large lower body repatterining.
