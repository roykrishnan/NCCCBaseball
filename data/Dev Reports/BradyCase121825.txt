Pitch Profile: 

Case shows fastball instability, with the movement profile deviating substantially on each pitch, this must be rectified to consistent behavior in game. Furthermore, the curveball and slider do not profile as different pitches, and scrapping one to optimally develop another to have more sweep would be more beneficial for long term development. 

Strength Profile: 

Case shows a concurring lack of IR power in the arm, a 1.68 ratio will not allow for proper arm unloading in the delivery and it is extremely important that this is resolved (not only from a development POV, but from an arm health POV as well). Peak Trunk Rotation Impulses and Rate of Force Development are low, as well as broad jump numbers, solidifying the lack of strength ability for the college level.  

Biomechanics Profile: 

Case is late in ball release as a result of a pushy arm motion simply because he lacks the strength in internal rotation to do so properly, for comparison, this is your lowest IR ratio for a healthy mid 80s thrower in our current database.
