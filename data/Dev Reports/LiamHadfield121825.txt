Pitch Profile: 

Liam has a fastball that touched 95 MPH on the stalker from a 5 foot release slot that profiles really well. The fastball's shape itself needs to be molded better, having both high horizontal break values and high vertical break values. This lends itself to a unicorn profile, as if we were to get some of the horizontal break down, we could create the rising sinker effect similar to Josh Hader as he throws out of the same slot just from the left side. 

Strength Profile: 

Lower half could use a little bit strengthening, but not much as he just misses the ratio cutoff at 0.8. Upper body could use more definitive strengthening. Broad jump values are good, however, both legs struggle with poor eccentric control which could lead to a week front foot block.

Biomechanics Profile: 

Arm can get somehow pushy into release, while pelvis never really stabilizes due to a weak from foot block. Creating eccentric control in the lower half will help fix this
