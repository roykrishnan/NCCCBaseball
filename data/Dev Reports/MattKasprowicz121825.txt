Pitch Profile: 

Kasprowicz has a dead zone fastball that should be shifted into a gyro sinker to fully take advantage of the shape he has (can turn this pitch into a bowling ball to hit) which can be done by killing about 5 inches of break vertically. Slider has that gyro profile that you'll see in MLB arms like Luis Castillo. Changeup is a really good pitch, that could do with a touch more vertical break killed. 

Strength Profile: 

Kasprowicz has a strong lower and upper body profile. Trunk rotational ability is on the lower end, signaling the need for more peak values and strength there. No mobility or trunk restrictions. 


Biomechanics Profile: 

Poor trunk rotator with low peak values, most likely due to his deficiencies in rotation found during the strength screening.
