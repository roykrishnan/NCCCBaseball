Pitch Profile: 

Kayden Duncan shows the best separation on his pitches across the staff. Fastball vertical break should be killed more to have it profile as a true two seamer (currently averaging 14' vertical break and 17' horizontal break, getting the vertical in the 9-13' window will improve fastball shape and get it out of this pseudo dead zone). Changeup and slider are good pitches; though slider on its own doesn't grade highly, but plays well off of the other two pitches (so usage will matter with it a lot more) 

Strength Profile: 

Excellent athlete, by far the best one on the team. Duncan leads the force plate leaderboards in anything fast twitch tissue related, which shows an excellent profile for velocity addition. Great in the concentric phase (acceleration up), more progress could be made in the eccentric phase (loading), which will natively come for him by adding more lean mass. Upper half development is needed as well, as his plyometric pushup numbers do not match up as well with with his lower body force production numbers (which are great in the acceleration phase). One cause for concern is just how fast and mobile he is, meaning he relies on outlier ranges to create these speeds and we have to make sure we train the full ranges on motions he does have in order to conserve them. 


Biomechanics Profile: 

Really good, no major changes need to be made here right now. Emphasis should be on developing his lean mass and loading heavily in the weight room. Extremely high potential to be. High 80s/low 90s thrower with the right development. One cause for concern is just how fast and mobile he is, meaning he relies on outlier ranges to create these speeds and we have to make sure we train the full ranges on motions he does have in order to conserve them.
