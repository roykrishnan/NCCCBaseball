Pitch Profile: 

Munzert has inconsistent shape on most of pitches that need to be cleaned up for him to get the expected behavior from his arsenal. His fastball profiled at 16.2 inches of vertical break and 11.7 inches of horizontal break, showcasing the need for better average shape (as this sits in the dead zone). Off speed shapes are suboptimal as well and an identify needs to be found to dial in his arsenal. 


Strength Profile: 

Munzert could use a little more development in the lower half, and a little more Internal Rotation power in the shoulder complex. Single leg broad jumps that profile below the team average show he could use more single leg bounding exercises and increasing the power in both independently, great range of motion values show the ability to gain velocity fast if he can maintain these with increased force production values.  


Biomechanics Profile: 

Low peak values in the lower half most likely due to the issues isolated in the strength profile.
