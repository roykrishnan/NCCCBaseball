Pitch Profile: 

Mashanic shows optimal deviation with each pitch, though the fastballs tend to blend together slightly (killing vertical break on the two seamer will allow it to play better off of the four seamer). 

Strength Profile: 

Mashanic was unable to do complete lower body testing as a result of a sprained ankle, from limited data we can conclude his lower half is strong enough. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Mechanics are essentially optimal, we hope some of the ground for metrics on the lower end in the lower body can be resolved with a healthy ankle.
