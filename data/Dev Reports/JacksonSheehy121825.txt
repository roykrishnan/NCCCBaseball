Pitch Profile: 

Good pitch profile with no major changes needed at the moment. 

Strength Profile: 

More concentric force development will complement a hop test ranking in the 96th percentile for tissue reactivity. Upper half development is below average as well, as well as trunk rotation values on both sides and a below average single leg broad jump from the left side. Poor left side cervical rotation found in the table screening as well. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Poor left side cervical rotation could be contributing factor in poor hip to shoulder separation values that lead to poor torso peak forces in the kinematic sequence. Solving these at source will allow us to see how much of this is an awareness issue versus an ability issue.
