Pitch Profile: 

Reece Boyle has good average shapes, building familiarity with the slider will allow him to create more consistent sweeper movement with it. 


Strength Profile: 

Average trunk rotational ability with low concentric ability shown on the force plates. Creating better rate of force development will allow him to better himself as an athlete. All his other strength metrics profile as just average, could use better strength across the board. 


Biomechanics Profile: 

Arm path could be reworked to be more consistent (has a pushy arm motion as a result of nothing getting into external rotation well in the throwing arm), which will help with command if that is an issue for him. External rotation is also very low, so shortening this arm action up could also help him with that.
