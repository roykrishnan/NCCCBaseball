Pitch Profile: 

Off speed shapes need to be dialed in, slider and curveball are extremely similar currently, and creating separation between the two is needed. 

Strength Profile: 

Polcovich shows good strength in the lower body and upper body, but power ER power in the shoulder complex in arm care testing as well as a single leg broad jump off of his loading (left) side profile below average. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Early shoulder internal rotation as a product of earlier trunk rotation, something we see often in lefties that create cut ride instead of the usual left seam shifted wake that creates horizontal movement instead.
