Pitch Profile: 

Kieran Glassford was not throwing 100% and only threw fastballs, therefore, we shouldn't read too much into the data, however, will be imperative to keep him healthy as he's one of only two LHP options on staff. 


Strength Profile: 

Good trunk numbers, poor concentric ability, will benefit from more rate of force development exercises in the lower half (acceleration out of depth). Shoulder External rotation currently within a normal range, but with it being less than shoulder internal rotation, eccentric drills to strength external rotation will help him bridge the load of a long season (especially coming off of injury).  


Biomechanics Profile; 

Glassford does not sequence effectively, currently his torso and pelvis move as one. With 3 Cervical/thoracic vertebrae removed due to tumor on spinal cord and thoracic kyphosis, this might be unable to correct, but gaining him a feel for an independently moving pelvis from his torso might gain him a few miles per hour. Throwing on data collection was also done at sub maximal intent, therefore, might not be indicative of how he actually throws.
