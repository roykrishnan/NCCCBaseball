Pitch Profile: 

Good pitch profile, fastball and changeup are camouflaged well (but changeup will not play well without high fastball usage). Curveball is sharp and distinct, at the Division 1 Level a cutter or slider shape will most likely be added to create some shape close to the zero line (vertical) or Quadrant II.

Strength Profile: 

High level lower body development required as Gruarin is very clearly concentric deficient with the need for more explosive power and rate of force development in the lower half. Rotational ability needs to be further built out, however, Gruarin has the unique ability to time force impulse up very well given his frame evidenced by the lack of outlier ability during a normal broad jump, but the presence of outlier ability when an arm swing is included. A poorer ability to create force in the shoulder during internal rotation is present, which will need to be fixed to move past his history with throwing shoulder impingements. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Good lower half mechanics are optimal, with a lack of arm unloading ability when throwing the baseball leading to poor dynamic arm IR values. This needs to be addressed at the source, the strength component for IR is low and must be fixed first for any biomechanics changes to really take root.
