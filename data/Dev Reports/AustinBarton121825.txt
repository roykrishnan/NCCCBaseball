Pitch Profile: 

Barton shows a distinct profile in pitch shapes, though dialing in slider shape or potentially switching to a cutter/slutter type of pitch will help deepen the gap between curveball and slider. Fastball/Changeup camouflage well, however for the changeup to play well on its own it will require the killing of some vertical break. 

Strength Profile: 

Barton is almost at our optimal lower half range (0.03 away), and as he profiles strongly in all body displacement (jump) metrics, can stand to add more concentric force production. Trunk rotation is fine, however, he is on the higher scale for IR instabilities in the arm care testing, which might make it difficult to unload the arm from external rotation when fatigued, leading to a pushier delivery. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Barton is slightly late getting the arm into internal rotation, which is not a mechanics issue as much as an IR strength issue. Building better rate of force development in IR (pullovers, pulldowns etc.) will be imperative to further development.
