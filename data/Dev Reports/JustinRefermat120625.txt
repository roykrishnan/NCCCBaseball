Pitch Profile: 

Justin Refermat shows too large of a variation of his pitches, meaning his pitches are really inconsistent in their break profile, the good ones are solid, but the bad ones are non-competitive in the conferences and don't move as they should. Dialing in feel, and putting an emphasis on making his misses competitive will be imperative to him being an effective contributor.  


Strength Profile:

Justin Refermat shows concentric deficiencies, meaninging developing rate of force from depth will be needed to advance as an athlete. Dorsiflexion on the landing leg (left leg ankle flexion) being improved will also allow him to improve ground force through the kinetic chain. Injury history with that left ankle means this will have to be done carefully. 


Biomechanics Profile: 
Knee extension velocity and knee flexion could both be higher (ability to lead leg block well). Start from the ground up in improving this, by fixing the ankle flexion issues, and see if this will correspond to a better lead leg block. Better blocking allows is correlated with an increase of fastball velocity. Hip shoulder separation at ball release can also potentially be improved after the blocking is fixed.
