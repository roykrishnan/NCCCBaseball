Pitch Profile: 

Putney has a great fastball changeup combo but will need to dial in the more consistent vertical shape on his fastball to reap the full benefits from it. Curveball is more gyro in nature, and could see better grades with increased depth (through one with proper depth). Killing vertical break on the changeup will also allow it to be graded highly as a separate pitch, not just camouflaged well off of the fastball. 

Strength Profile: 

Ashton has some concentric deficiencies in the lower half, which can be expected for someone with a more slender build, adding lean mass will ensure this is rectified as well as continuing to build the size and strength in the lower half. Putney is a really great athlete, able to mobilize force fast, and leading the team in overall jumping ability. Upper half can also be further developed as well as peak forces rotationally. High velocity development still left on this frame. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Putney has good mechanics, the femur flares slightly too much when the front foot hits, which might lead some cutting off the baseball, but it is still within a normal range (though on the higher side of it), cleaning this up can lead to more consistent pitch flight.
