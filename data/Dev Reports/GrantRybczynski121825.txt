Pitch Profile: 

Curveball could use more depth to create more deflection off of the fastball. 

Strength Profile: 

Good upper and lower body strength profile. Poorer rotator, and can do well with more peak force. Not officially problematic, but could also do well with more internal rotation ability the throwing arm and a better single leg broad jump from the left side (closely correlated with rotation). No mobility restrictions.

Biomechanics Profile: 

Good biomechanics profile with no major changes needed.
