Pitch Profile: 

Kelly's movement profile is very cut heavy, every single one of his pitches are at the zero line or in Quadrant II, this will make him super exposed to left handed hitter barrels, and is also why out pitcher sorting algorithm is picking him up as a left handed pitchers. Creating a more diverse profile will be necessary to getting all types of hitters out consistently. 

Strength Profile: 

Kelly is on the lower end of concentric deficiencies (meaning he is close to hitting our lower body goals but not quite), and could use a little more quick explosive ability from depth to help get him there. More focus on the left leg while improving this could lead to better tissue reactivity and a better block. Upper half strength is fine, but there is significant differences between rotational power on both sides, improving the right side could help with more stability in the pitching motion. 


Biomechanics Profile: 

Everything rotates very early with Andrew Kelly, pelvis all the way to the arm, if the goal is to not have cut on every pitch this has to be rectified first. Being able to hold counterrotation longer will allow him to be a more complete pitcher arsenal wise.
