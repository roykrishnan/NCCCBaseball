Pitch Profile: 

Great separation on all pitches, killing a touch more horizontal break (1-2 inches) could benefit the fastball slightly. It has a 60th percentile shape, so getting it more outlier in behavior will only benefit him.  


Strength Profile: 

Upper half could use some more peak force development, good reactive tissue in a well profiling lower half that will benefit from further lean mass addition. Trunk rotation values are low, and can stand to be improved in every facet. Sleep needs to be better. Great range of motion in trunk and in external rotation in the throwing arm. Really good candidate for velocity gain with trunk ability increases and lean mass additions.


Biomechanics Profile: 

Low trunk rotation values most likely due to poor rotational power found in strength testing.
