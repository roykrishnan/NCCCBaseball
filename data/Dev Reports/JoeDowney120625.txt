Pitch Profile: 

Joe Downey's four seam fastball should right away be scrapped in favor of the two seam fastball, at essentially the same velocity he gets 2-3 inches more of horizontal break and therefore a much better profiling pitch. Changeup grip needs to be changed to try and replicate the same axis as his two seam fastball, to try and recreate the same shape, just at a lower velocity. Slider should also be tinkered with to create more of a sweeper (has gyro shape right now) in order to create a larger movement profile, as being able to start sweepers and two seamers down the middle and watch them run to opposite ends of the zone could be a huge tool in simplifying pitch tunneling. Slider backs up a lot currently, because it has too much vertical break on average, something to get more around the baseball as a girl or cue would be huge. 


Strength Profile: 

Joe Downey struggled with creating explosive force from depth and his trunk rotation has to be bettered from the right side, this is within the zone to develop hip/back/oblique issues, his internal rotation on the right side is already flagged as problematic, and this is where the bulk of training time should be spent on. Creating more strength out of depth (explosive squats, single leg lunges exploding up etc.) and fixing these mobility/rotation issues will lead to velocity gain.


Biomechanics Profile: 

Low slot thrower that can use more internal rotation in the back leg. Lack of internal rotation (found in both trunk testing and on the table screening) leads to him locking out his back hip, not allowing for adequate counter rotation in that back leg, something that is imperative to creating velocity for lower slot throwers.
