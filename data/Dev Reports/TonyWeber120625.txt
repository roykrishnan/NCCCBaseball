Pitch Profile: 

Tony Weber has a solid three pitch mix that shape wise does not need to be touched. 


Strength Profile: 

Tony's concentric deficiencies show us that he needs to develop more rate of force development (acceleration from depth) I order to take the next step as an athlete. Significant trunk imbalance needs to be addressed as his right rise is severely lacking behind his left. External rotation of the arm could be improved especially if he is expected to have a high workload this year (as these values start to minimize with fatigue). 
 
Biomechanics Profile: 

Poor external rotation in the shoulder is more likely the product of the dynamic deficiency found in the arm care screening part of the total assessment. Otherwise all other mechanics are relatively average.
