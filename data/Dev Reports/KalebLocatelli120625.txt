Pitch Profile:
 
Needs to dial in shapes consistently, lot of variation in his fastballs and his sliders (within both), which hurts command and pitch calling when you can't expect a pitch to break consistently. Dead zone fastball suggests switching to a sinker type of grip to turn that low spin into an even better ground ball pitch. 

Strength Profile; 

Low concentric development numbers indicate the need to create more explosive ability from depth. Poor Squat jump and Hop jump performance further reiterates the inability to move body mass well through space and will benefit from better plyometric training. Significant imbalances in the torso and poor peak force numbers also highlights the need to get stronger rotationally, with both left side and right side numbers being among the lowest on the team. Strong candidate for velocity gain if this can happen. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Biomechanics data corrupted, however, there are so many limiting factors in the strength profile that is where the most grid can be done over the next several months.
