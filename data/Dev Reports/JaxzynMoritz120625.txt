Pitch Profile: 

Jaxzyn Moritz profiles as average in each and every pitch he throws, so it will be important to balance usage across them effectively, as he doesn't have pitch that profiles unbelievably well. Ensuring this is communicated in an effective manner, and that all these pitches are able to be thrown for strikes in different count states will ensure maximum effectiveness. 

Strength Profile: 

Moritz has an adequate strength profile, however, weighing in at 156.9 lbs lean mass needs to be further added so he can in fact create better peak force measurables.


Biomechanics Profile: 
Moritz's mechanics are essentially perfect until he begins moving towards home plate (the load phase is great). When he does start moving toward home plate, thoracic extension happens early, pulling the arm out of external rotation instead of letting it relax into it. For a football quarterback, this is somewhat expected as these would be the upper half mechanics used to throw a football. Getting him to relax into external rotation before accelerating the arm into ball release (internal rotation) will be imperative to him taking he next step mechanically as a pitcher.
