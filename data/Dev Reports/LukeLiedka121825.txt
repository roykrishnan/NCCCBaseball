Pitch Profile: 

Good separation on pitches, arsenal does not need to be touches but a Quadrant II pitch will most likely have to be added in the next level (cutter or sweeper shape). 

Strength Profile: 
Liedka profiles at 0.7 on the E/C Ratio showing room for lower body strength ability to be added in the concentric phase. Solid upper half with no major movement restrictions, though the lateral jump off of the right side can be improved and fixing this will help with some of the lower body concentric metrics as well. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Arm is slightly late into ball release, however, this doesn't affect the shape of the fastball at all as it is offset by his pronation.
