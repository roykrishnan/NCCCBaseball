Pitch Profile: 

Nick Gold has a distinct pitch profile that could be improved by deepening the separation difference between his four seam fastball and his two seam fastball, otherwise, a really good optimal arsenal that will play well within the conference.  

Strength Profile:

Weak concentric profile and poor squat jump, alleviating these through better programming will allow him to grow as an athlete. Poor trunk performance overall, as well as significant imbalances in the trunk need to be fixed in order to mitigate any injury risk, and allow him to be better rotationally. 


Biomechanics Profile: 

Poor knee flexion and external rotation are most likely the product of the strength profile deficiencies. Alleviating those will better allow us to understand whether this is a biomechanics problem or a strength problem presenting itself as a biomechanics problem.
