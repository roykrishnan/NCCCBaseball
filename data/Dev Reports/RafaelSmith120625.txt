Pitch Profile: 

Rafael Smith has the strongest three pitch arsenal on this team with distinct separation between all three pitches. Shapes do not need to be tweaked at all. 

Strength Profile: 

Smith is among the worst on the team at creating concentric force and will benefit from bringing his poor ratio up. Fixing peak impulses (speed) in rotational ability going the right way (rotating the opposite way in which he throws) will help curb any potential hip/lower back issues with high usage. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Smith has an adequate biomechanics profile, with some of the lacking characteristics (for someone who has previously been up to 88( lacking because of his strength deficiencies.
