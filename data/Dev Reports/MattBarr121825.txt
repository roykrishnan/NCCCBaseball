Pitch Profile: 

An electric fastball, Barr's biggest unicorn talent is the ability to create elite vertical shape with high spin rates while being a hard thrower. Fastball will and always should be his highest usage pitch, and curveball shows great depth off of it. Cutter shape needs to be cleaned up, as the shape is getting too big at points (indicative) of a slider, which we want to avoid to ensure that bats aren't getting sped up artificially when looking for the higher speed pitch but getting the other. 


Strength Profile: 
Barr actually profiles as eccentric deficient, which we sometimes see in athletes that are this powerful. This means stabilizing the lower body can be tough for him after ball release (ex. 'the brakes' need work). Fixing this deficiency will allow for better velocity stabilization, with velo not fluctuating as much appearance to appearance. Poor eccentric control in single leg exercises further evidenced this find, and improving those eccentrically will have some huge implications for him. Every other strength metric is optimal.
